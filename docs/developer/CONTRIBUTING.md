## How to contribute to OSIDB

### Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under
  [Issues](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osidb/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem:

  * If you are [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) associate and you are requesting company specific
    functionality open a new issue
    [here](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=12332734&issuetype=1).

  * Otherwise open a new issue [here](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osidb/issues/new).

* Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible,
  and a comand line or code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the
  expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting make sure that linters and tests are passing.
  Details on running the test can be found [here](DEVELOP.md#run-tests).
  Also make sure that the CI pipelines report success in the PR.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability,
functionality, or testability of the project will generally not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Simply create a pull request and wait for the feedback.

### Do you have questions about the source code?

We unfortunately do not have a publicly accessible discussion channel yet.
You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osidb/issues/new)
and ask your question within.

### Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

Simply create a pull request and wait for the feedback.
