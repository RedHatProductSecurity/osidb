## Unreleased
### Changed
- Authentication is no longer compulsory for read-only requests against the
  main OSIDB endpoints such as /flaws, /affects and /trackers (OSIDB-313)

## [2.1.0] - 2022-08-02
### Changed
- disable krb5 log redirection in stage and production playbooks.
- disable opportunistic_auth when contacting Errata Tool and removed
  the authentication call from the constants file which meant that
  ET authentication would happen every time the code was loaded, generating
  a lot of auth calls and logs.
- change the way that data is synchronized to be more fault-tolerant,
  things like tracker fetching will no longer make the entire flaw
  sync fail.
- fix a bug where only certain metadata were being correctly synchronized
  between BZ and OSIDB which resulted in things like typos in acknowledgments
  persisting in OSIDB despite being removed from BZ.
- fix a bug in which the scheme in next/previous links in paginated
  responses was http:// and not https://.
- fix a bug with the way that the collector framework parsed crontab
  strings.
- fix various bugs with the collector framework instantiation process.
- fix a bug with the way that collector dependencies were being handled.
- fix a bug in which FlawMeta were not being updated correctly due to
  an ACL issue.
- update product exclusion lists.
- fix a bug in which the exploit collectors were not working properly
  due to an ACL issue.
- fix an issue with duplicate affects generating database errors.

### Added
- add various Dockerfile optimizations.
- add API for exploit report processing.
- add a mechanism to reflect CVE changes and/or removals.

### Removed
- remove audit mechanisms and tables from main models.

## [2.0.3] - 2022-06-16
### Changed
- fix an issue with existing FlawMeta objects not being updated if the
  parent Flaw was itself updated, meaning that FlawMeta could be kept
  as embargoed if the Flaw was unembargoed.

## [2.0.2] - 2022-06-14
### Changed

  the changes to the empty value of enumerations from "" back to "NONE",
  only IRD clients should be affected.
