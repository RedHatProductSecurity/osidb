- change the way that data is synchronized to be more fault-tolerant,
  things like tracker fetching will no longer make the entire flaw
  sync fail.
- fix a bug where only certain metadata were being correctly synchronized
  between BZ and OSIDB which resulted in things like typos in acknowledgments
  persisting in OSIDB despite being removed from BZ.
- fix a bug in which the scheme in next/previous links in paginated
  responses was http:// and not https://.
- fix a bug with the way that the collector framework parsed crontab
  strings.

  an ACL issue.
