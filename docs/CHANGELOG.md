## Unreleased
### Changed
- disabled krb5 log redirection in stage and production playbooks.
- disabled opportunistic_auth when contacting Errata Tool and removed
  the authentication call from the constants file which meant that
  ET authentication would happen every time the code was loaded, generating
  a lot of auth calls and logs.

  main OSIDB endpoints such as /flaws, /affects and /trackers (OSIDB-313)
