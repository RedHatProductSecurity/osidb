# This hack is necessary in order to set ACLs after authentication
# the normal way to do this would be through a Middleware, however
# DRF does not perform token authentication at the middleware level
# but instead does it later on at the view level, thus making the
# actual user performing the request unavailable inside Middleware
# code. This issue has been raised in the DRF multiple times but
# nothing has been done nor is there any plan to fix it.
