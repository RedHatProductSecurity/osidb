# SLA definition
# every item in the list below defines one specific SLA policy
#
# the SLA computation procedure works as follows
#
#   1) for every SLA policy and the given tracker
#      we find a flaw-affect-tracker combination
#      (multiple affects/flaws may relate to a tracker)
#
#      a) which meets the SLA policy conditions
#
#      b) and results in the earlist SLA end
#
#   2) among all (flaw-affect-tracker|SLA policy) pairs
#
#      a) the one resulting in the earlist SLA end
#         is chosen as the tracker SLA determinating
#
#      b) or if there is no applicable SLA policy the tracker
#         is not bound by any SLA and the procedure ends here
#
#   3) the SLA start and end timestamps are calculated based on
#      the chosen SLA policy and flaw-affect-tracker combination
