# This file includes a list of RSS feeds from which we periodically pull
# the latest entries. This file uses the YAML syntax.
#
# Each entry *must* include a URL (field name "url") from which the feed
# entries are pulled, and if available a components list (field name
# "components" containing a list of related components).
#
# Each entry *must* include a "meta" section with a "description" and
# "reason" fields, the purpose of which is:
#
# - description: includes short information about the feed we are scraping.
#
# - reason: includes reasoning for why we are watching a particular feed.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not modify existing feed names (e.g. "name: Ruby on Rails
# Security"). These are used to identify snippets and perform special
# actions on certain types of feed snippets.
